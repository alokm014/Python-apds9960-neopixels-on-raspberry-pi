How to control NeoPixel LEDs with Gesture in Python on a Raspberry Pi!

Python library for the apds9960 with neopixels on raspberry-pi developed while I was looking to get the APDS-9960 to work with a Raspberry Pi.
First of all i would like to thank https://github.com/ThomasWaldmann for APDS-9960 library and also https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x/commits?author=Gadgetoid for neopixel library.
